## Pacman Reinforcement Learning Pipeline

Reinforcement Learning Pipeline to train a Python based agent to learn how to play a PacMan style game built in a C++ environment.

## Project Status

This project is currently in testing. The communication between the Python model and the C++ environment via JSON IO-pipelines works. The basic training architecture (replay buffer and DQN) works and has been successfully tested on a minimal version of the game.
Currently working on upscaling the training to more complex versions of the game by refining feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
